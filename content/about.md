&#x1F44B; Hi! Scott J. Forman here, the person whose website this is. 

You might know me as the founder of [Vote Forward](https://votefwd.org), a nonprofit that works to increase civic participation by organizing volunteers to send handwritten letters to their fellow citizens. More than a quarter million people have written a letter, and more than 30 million have been sent since 2018.

I was also an early employee at [Opower](https://opower.com) where I helped develop software-powered direct mail programs that have, to date, saved the world 31 terawatt-hours of energy.

My brother once characterized me as an "accomplished indoorsman." More recently, I've become a sort of intermediate outdoorsman. 

I'll write posts on this site about both indoors and out. Topics may include meditation, backpacking, piano practice, books, politics, and my own explorations and experiments.

I have a particular interest in the human implications of technology, and in how technology can be used to promote human thriving.

I live in beautiful downtown Oakland, CA.
