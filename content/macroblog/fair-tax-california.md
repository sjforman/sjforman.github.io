I got a little fixated on [this](https://twitter.com/sjforman/status/1760489338234962150). I wanted some kind of inverse of the [Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association obscenity](https://www.hjta.org/resources/taxpayer-tools/guessing-game-tax-calculator/) to exist, so I channeled my ire into building a little microsite to expose the grotesque unfairness of Prop 13: [Fair Tax California](https://www.fairtaxcalifornia.org/).

So far I have:

 * [A calculator](https://www.fairtaxcalifornia.org/calculate). It accepts an "assessed value" and a "market value" and computes your savings or additional obligations under a fairer tax regime. 
 * [A comparison tool](https://www.fairtaxcalifornia.org/compare) that highlights some particularly egregious mismatches between pairs of very similar properties.
 * [A leaderboard](https://www.fairtaxcalifornia.org/gawk) for champion property tax freeloaders. The current leader is my example from San Diego. Second place is [@Rohin’s](https://twitter.com/rohindhar/status/1763666051202760976) example in San Francisco. Find more and send them to me! I’ll add them.

The "fairer tax regime" envisioned by that calculator: in San Diego county, the average value of the parcels with assessed values in the most recent available year (2022) is $1.6M. The average assessed value of *all the other parcels* is $639k. 

That means that if the overall average were equal to the recent average, the tax *base* would be $1.8 trillion, vs. the current value of $695 billion. [Aside: America is unfathomably wealthy. A single county in California — $1.8 trillion!]. I think of the ratio of these numbers as the Prop 13 Distortion Index. For San Diego county it's currently 2.59, and growing every year.

The upshot: if we used market valuations for assessment, the tax *rate* could fall from an average of 1.2% to just 0.46% and produce an equal tax *take* as currently. **Without the distortion of Prop 13, the tax rate could be lowered by almost two thirds with no loss of revenue.** 

Is this how we ought to reform Prop 13? I'm not sure! But I think we ought to consider something along these lines. We could start by just making the system more *fair*, without making the overall tax burden any higher. Our deliberations on whether to raise more revenue can then be subject to normal democratic processes.
