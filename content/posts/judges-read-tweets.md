I wonder whether judges tend to be aware of these sorts of statements while deliberating & drafting opinions. Some of them must be, by chance or habit, the extremely online ones. But I would hope there are intra-office processes to apprise the rest of them, because even though it's outside the official record, it seems like important context!
