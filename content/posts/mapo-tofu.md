Here's a recent mise en place for the vegan one:

Thanks to Serious Eats for the [excellent recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-vegan-mapo-tofu-recipe). Turned out quite deliciously. So much so we forgot to take a picture of the end result, too busy devouring. The mushrooms in the tofu really work beautifully. J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt is a treasure!
