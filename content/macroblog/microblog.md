title: RSS is all we need

Up there in the navigation for this site there's a "Microblog" link. If you click on it, you'll see a feed of, well, micro-...stuff, that I've published through a system I built that I'm calling Pubfeed. It's my attempt at demonstrating an alternative, and I would argue, healthier model for social media. I think of it as, in a sense, *anti*-social media.

## The Platforms Are Poison

Social media is toxic and poisonous, and we all know it. From our own experience. From carefully conducted empirical and experimental evidence like X, in which Y. We've even seen some recent evidence that we'd be willing to *pay* for everyone else to stop using it, so we could stop, too. (Citation). It's a toxic equilibrium. We can't quit because our friends on it, but we'd all be better off if we could.

## Blame The Incentives 

Why so toxic? Because of the incentives. The companies that run the platforms are sell our attention to their advertisers. And the best way to capture our attention is to stoke hot emotions like anger and fear. Ever thus — "if it bleeds, it leads" — but now, supercharged.

## There's Something Good Here

There's nothing inherently wrong with "low-friction publishing of thoughts and ideas on the internet." A worldwide open publishing platform is a miracle!

My (probably utopian and wrong) thesis is that the *centralized platforms* aren't necessary to achieve this. I think we can get most of the benefits by reviving an older approach. Remember Google Reader? That was a better world!

## Maybe RSS is Enough  

So here's what I wondered: how far can we get using just a reliable old friend, RSS? A Really Simple way to handle publication and subscription? 

*I* don't want to be on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram or Tiktok anymore. All *I* want is an RSS feed to publish photos and stray thoughts and whatnot. So I took a stab at building a platform to make that as easy as possible. 

So the purpose of Pubfeed is to make it easy for anyone to have a feed of their own, and to publish what they want on their own terms.

## Your Data is Yours

## You're Not Tied to This

## Simplicity is Durability

## What's Missing?

# By The Way

The futzing about with likes and retweets and whatnot is also just *embarrasing* and undignifed. We're not meant to live like that.

## Possible Future Directions

A modern reader.

An aggregation model. 

A richer schema.

A modest pricetag. 

## Just Opt Out

This is why I built Pubfeed. As a quixotic and probably hopeless gesture in the direction of healthier internet discourse. We bemoan the state of the social media. And we can each just choose to quit. So let's.
