Could gene drives help eradicate bedbugs?

<!--more-->

Gene drives for mosquito control have been much discussed. And we should quit dithering and deploy them.

But then we should go further. 

A terrible story I heard about a friend in NYC recently got me wondering: is anyone working on similar systems for other arthropods? 

If so I would like to nominate Cimex lectularius.
